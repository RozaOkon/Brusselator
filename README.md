Investigating the deterministic chaos in Brusselator - the model of a process with positive feedback step

The Brusselator is a model of a process with positive feedback stage, e.g. a chemical reaction with an autocatalytic step. With an appropriate selection of parameters initial conditions systems described by this model exhibit interesting, complex behaviors - e.g. the occurance of cyclic atractors on its trajectory.

The equations of Brusselator's chemical reaction equations as well as differential equations describing its kinetics are depicted in 'model_equations.png' file in the repository.

In my project I was looking for possibilities for deterministic chaos to occur in periodically, non-stochastically forced Brusselator.
